This Spring Boot app uses both MVC and REST controllers. Thymeleaf templates are used for the Admin and Doctor dashboards, while the other modules work through REST APIs. The app connects to two databases: MySQL (for patients, doctors, appointments, and admins) and MongoDB (for prescriptions). All requests go from the controllers to the service layer, which then calls the right repository. MySQL uses JPA entities, and MongoDB uses document models.
